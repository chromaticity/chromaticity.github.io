                            This is a simple application that allows you to search for bars and their happy hours. This app was made using Laravel as the back-end and ReactJS as the front-end. This was a collaboration between myself with the back-end, and my friend <a href="https://ubben.co/">@ubben</a> who did a lot of the front-end and ReactJS section. No Google APIs are being used in the application (other than it was used to scrape bar information). Currently only functions with zip codes in the Los Angeles area. The back-end functions as an API that serves the data and handles authentication, and the ReactJS side uses the API to display information to the user.

                            This is a simple application that allows you to do tasks. First, you sign up. Then, you
                            join a group with other friends, co-workers, family, or any other group of people. The group then
                            contributes tasks to the group, and tasks will appear in real time to all of the members of the group.
                            Once all tasks are placed, they will be randomly assigned to different people in the group. The program
                            will make sure that everyone is assigned as much equal amount of work as possible. Weights can also
                            be assigned to the task, with a difficulty scale. Members will also be able to mark tasks as done, in progress, or unassigned. More features will be added as people request them.
